# Car Rental Company App

This repository contains the source code for a car rental application developed using React, React Redux, and Styled Components. The application allows users to browse, search, and rent cars for various purposes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application's frontend is built using React to create a responsive and interactive user experience.

- **React Redux**: State management is handled efficiently with React Redux, ensuring a predictable state container and seamless communication between components.

- **Styled Components**: For styling, we utilize Styled Components, a popular CSS-in-JS library. This approach provides a modular and maintainable styling solution directly integrated with our React components.
